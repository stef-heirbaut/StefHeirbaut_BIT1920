A research lab keeps track of all projects PhD students and lab technicians work on. This data consists of

Personnel number
Name
Date of birth
Lab code
Lab name
Research code
Research description
Research supervisor
Normalise this data up to 3NF, taking in to account these constraints:

Each personnel number is unique
Each lab has a single lab code
Each research project has a single code and supervisor
Each member of the personnel may work on one or more research projects
Personnel names need not necessarily be unique
Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields
Save the results of each normalisation step, together with a description of the steps you took in a document with a clear name. Add this document to your git-repository and choose a suiting commit-message.

UNF: Lab(PersonnelNo, Name, Date-of-birth, Lab code, Lab name, Research code, Research description, Research supervisor)


1NF: 
each cell is single valued 			dont know if the cells are single valued but we assume it is
each column has the same type		we assume that each column has the same type
each row has a unique value			oke because the personnel number is unique


 Lab(PersonnelNo, Name, Date-of-birth, Lab code, Lab name, Research code, Research description, Research supervisor)



2NF:
all attributes (non key columns) depend on a key

the lab name doesnt depend on the key (in this case the personnelNo) but it depends on the Lab code --> so a new table lab is created
research description and research supervisor depends on the research code --> new table research 
the other attributes all depend on the key personnelNo --> table person

person (personnelNo, Name, Date-of-Birth, research code, lab code)
Lab (Lab code, Lab Name)
Research (Research code, research description, research supervisor)


3NF:
all keys in the table can only be determined by the key in the table and no other column
this is already ok in the 2NF form 
2NF = 3NF


person (personnelNo, Name, Date-of-Birth, research code, lab code)
Lab (Lab code, Lab Name)
Research (Research code, research description, research supervisor)
